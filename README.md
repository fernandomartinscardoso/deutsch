This repository, aptly named "deutsch", serves as a centralized, version-controlled log for my journey in learning the German language. It's designed to track progress, store study materials, and document key concepts encountered during self-study, courses, or practice.

## 🚀 Goals

The primary goal of this repo is to systematically organize and review German language knowledge. It will evolve with my learning, providing a quick reference point for:

- __Grammar Rules__: Documenting complex structures (e.g., cases, verb conjugations, adjective endings).
- __Vocabulary Lists__: Curated lists for different topics, frequency, or difficulty levels.
- __Exercises & Solutions__: Storing completed practice sets or custom-made exercises.
- __Pronunciation & Phonetics__: Notes on challenging sounds or common mistakes.
- __Cultural Notes__: Brief insights into German-speaking culture that aid language understanding.
